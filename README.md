# Transliterator-for-Indian-languages
Given a text in an Indian language,it will be transliterated to another language which you are more comfortable reading.This is a streamlit web app.

Transliteration is when you convert a word written in one language such that it is written using the alphabet of the second language. 

Note that this is very different from “Translation” wherein you also convert the word itself to the second language so that it’s “meaning” is maintained.

We hardly think about transliteration which is very useful to pronounce text written in a language which we don’t know how to read.In this case,translation is not useful.

Eg:Kothanur Dinne is transliterated from Kannada.It cannot be translated from Kannada to English for it’s a locality in Bangalore!Kothanur is the same in all the languages!
